# Welcome to Reflective Assistant!

By Kaeden Bryer, Christina Carvalho, Maria Echeverri Solis and Malik Issani

This is our group's sophomore project at Oakland University. Reflective Assistant is the software for a smart mirror
which curates essential information for the user's morning.


## Requirements! (Read this everyone)

I've added the sample code I used to get the voice agent working. To use these, you will need to 1. install all the requirements in requirements.txt and 2. make sure you have the .env file. I've purpose committed the .env file so it should work out of the box for you guys, but know that that is bad practice. Use of API keys accumulates charges, so if the world got them I'd be bankrupt lol.

run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
make sure dotenv and load_dotenv() are working properly if anything fails.

You might have to restart vscode or your computer if you're getting an error saying API key invalid.

Let me know if there are any issues!

## Goals:
#### 1. Create the hardware for a functioning smart mirror✅


#### 2. Make several API calls to bring essential information to the user✅



#### 3. Create a modern UI/UX experience (WIP)


#### 4. Integrate support for control of other smart home devices (WIP)


#### 5. Integrate voice-control for the user to interact with the mirror (WIP)


#### 6. (Bonus) Integrate a real time voice assistant with visual capabilities (WIP)
